# thumbs-up üëç

Thumbnail server.

## Usage

```bash
$ docker run -ti -p 8009:8009 btimby/thumbs-up
```

## What is it?

This is a thumbnail and preview server. I can convert many file types into pdf
and png.

This project relies upon an external service, [officer-pdf](https://github.com/btimby/officer-pdf/) to support office documents. officer-pdf should be run behind a load balancer for medium to high load.

In addition, there are a number of libraries below that are used to do conversion directly within this service.
